# Tasker Prioritize
![all-devices-black (1)](frontend/src/assets/all-devices-black.png)
A small project, yet a favorite one!

A priority-queue for tasks, using MongoDB task collection.  
App behavior:  
In this app, you have control over the background service that automatically executes a task with the following criteria:  

- A task that has the highest importance gets executed first!
- When a task failed, it gets re-executed until it reaches 5 tried count!
- When the 5 tried count is reached and still in a failed status the task gets skipped in favor of other tasks
- As for the done percentage it counts as finished since the service does not retry it (it can still get manually retry)

Each task has a description with an error list that describes the error that occurs when failed  
And with all of that, you get a real-time interaction using WebSockets (**sometimes it gets stuck due to render.com limits where the app is hosted**)!
